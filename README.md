# Cleancode.ca

This repository is my personal blog. Originally forked from [Marko Radak's excellent Gatsby+Storybook starter](https://github.com/markoradak/gatsby-starter-storybook) which gave me a clean slate with Gatsby + Storybook to build upon. I then added Netlify CMS using [Alexander Shelepenok's Gatsby Lumen Starter](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen) as a rough guide. I've also added a contact form using [Netlify Forms](https://www.netlify.com/products/forms/) with [Google Recaptcha](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/v3.html), image optimization for both static pages and markdown-generated blog posts, blog tag cloud via [ReactTagcloud](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tagcloud) and styled codeblocks using [PrismJS](https://prismjs.com/).

In the future, I plan on adding unit testing with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as well as some end-to-end tests using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). I also plan on adding fast site search via [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/). Stay tuned for more updates to the blog!

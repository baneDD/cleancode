Hi there, my name is Bane and I am a Toronto-based software engineer. I love working on, architecting, leading and discussing software projects. My passion is code quality and I continuously strive to produce code that's clean, concise, readable, modular and performant. I love improving tools and processes around writing quality code and optimizing architecture for scalability, reliability and performance.

Software engineering is a field where continuous learning is paramount in order to keep abreast of the new technologies, tools and methodologies. It has been demonstrated by [many studies](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/00028312019002237) that teaching others deepens your own understanding of the subject and improves knowledge retention. With those benefits in mind, I created this blog intent on teaching some of the concepts in software I find challenging. Hopefully you will find it interesting and informative!

### About this site

← Read [about me](#)

</span>

This site is built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/). Originally forked from [Marko Radak's excellent Gatsby+Storybook starter](https://github.com/markoradak/gatsby-starter-storybook) which gave me a fairly clean slate with Gatsby + Storybook to build upon. I then added Netlify CMS using [Alexander Shelepenok's Gatsby Lumen Starter](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen) as a rough guide. I've also added a contact form using [Netlify Forms](https://www.netlify.com/products/forms/) with [Google Recaptcha](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/v3.html), image optimization for both static pages and markdown-generated blog posts, blog tag cloud via [ReactTagcloud](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tagcloud) and styled codeblocks using [PrismJS](https://prismjs.com/).

In the future, I plan on adding unit testing with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and end-to-end tests using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). I also plan on adding fast site search via [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/).

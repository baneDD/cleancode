I'm a web developer based out of Toronto focused on engaging, fun and innovative online experiences. Dedicated to crafting clean, readable, modular and performant code. While I can work solo, I thrive in team environments where I can make a contribution beyond just writing code. Working on system architecture, improving processes and mentoring and coaching more junior engineers is an enormously satisfying part of working within a team constuct. I love to learn new things and continuously improve my craft.

I’ve worked with major online retailers in North America including leading teams at Indigo and iHerb and helped improve web experience for one of the most popular online video games on the planet. Starting at Ryerson University where I won a contest to redesign and implement a portal for School of Computer Science, I’ve spent nearly a decade and a half mastering the craft of creating joyful online experiences.

If you want to work with me or simply want to get in touch and learn more, please [email me](mailto:bane.dd@gmail.com).
